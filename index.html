<p id="para"> <img src="MIATA.jpeg">Cars are motor vehicles primarily designed for transporting people rather than goods. They typically feature four wheels and run on roads, powered by engines that can be fueled by gasoline, diesel, or electricity. Inside, cars offer seating for passengers and a variety of controls and amenities, including air conditioning and infotainment systems. The body of the car provides protection and can vary in design from sedans and SUVs to hatchbacks and convertibles. Advanced technological features, such as the 1<sup>st</sup> airbags, anti-lock brakes, and electronic stability control, enhance safety for occupants. Overall, cars are an essential mode of transportation, offering convenience, mobility, and a range of options to suit different needs and preferences.</p>
